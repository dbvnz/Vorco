# Vorco Scripts

Scripts for Vorco customers to use for automation purposes.

If there's a task available through our customer portal you're interested in automating which a script is not available here for, or if you need assistance with retrieving your API key or service IDs, [contact us](https://www.vorco.net/contact-us).

To use these script, edit the variables in the top of the script as needed, then run from powershell. They can be set up to run as scheduled tasks if required.

### Retrieve Teams CDRs and Recordings.ps1
This script allows you to automate retrieval of CDRs and Recordings for a given number of days, and will automatically zip them for archival purposes.

### Update SkyPhone Call Forward Destination.ps1
This script allows you to set a list of phone numbers to cycle through for the call forward destination of a SkyPhone line.
One use case for this is on a scheduled task to run once a week to cycle through who is on call after hours for the week.
